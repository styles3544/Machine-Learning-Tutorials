These features should be available at the moment you want to make a predition, and they're unlikely to be changed in the training data after the prediction target is determined. But, the way he describes accuracy could be misleading if you aren't careful. If the price moves gradually, today's price will be an accurate predictor of tomorrow's price, but it may not tell you whether it's a good time to invest. For instance, if it is  100 dollars today, a price of 100 dollars tomorrow may seem accurate, even if it can't tell you whether the price is going up or down from the current price. A better prediction target would be the change in price over the next day. If you can consistently predict whether the price is about to go up or down (and by how much), you may have a winning investment opportunity.\n"

At an extreme, if only one home is sold in the neighborhood, and it is the home we are trying to predict, then the average will be exactly equal to the value we are trying to predict. In general, for neighborhoods with few sales, the model will perform very well on the training data.
